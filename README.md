# JSON2HTML
JSON to HTML converter written in php with simplistic GUI. Converter is written in Slovene, my native language.

Versions:

- JSON2HTML_1.0 -> Converter that works only on test files. (Slovene)
- JSON2HTML_2.0 -> Converter that works on most of JSON files with proper structure. (Slovene)
- JSON2HTML_3.0 -> Converter that works on most of JSON files with proper structure written in English.

NOTE: 

- JSON file that you want to convert has to be in the same folder as index.php.
- HTML file will be automaticly created and placed in the same folder as index.php. HTML file will be named ConvertedFile.html after running converter.
- App was made with assumption that JSON file has correct HTML structure
